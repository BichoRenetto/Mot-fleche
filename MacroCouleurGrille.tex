% Macros for the grid display and the coloring of the cells %

% Set a color value between Color1 and Color2 given the location of the cell
% Useless if you set Color1 = Color2 in the main document
\newcommand{\setcustomcolor}[2]{%
 % Arguments:
 %% #1 x-coordinate of the grid cell (left to right)
 %% #2 y-coordinate of the grid cell (up to bottom)
 \pgfmathtruncatemacro{\sum}{#1 + #2} % Calculate the sum
 \ifthenelse{\isodd{\sum}}{%
   \colorlet{customcolor}{Color1} % If the sum is odd, set customcolor to Color1
 }{%
   \colorlet{customcolor}{Color2} % If the sum is even, set customcolor to Color2
 }%
}

% Color a cell given its location and display a letter inside it
\newcommand{\fillcell}[3]{
 % Arguments:
 %% #1 x-coordinate of the grid cell (left to right)
 %% #2 y-coordinate of the grid cell (up to bottom)
 %% #3 a letter or blank space
 \setcustomcolor{#1}{#2} ;
 \pgfmathsetmacro{\xcoord}{(#1-1)*\SquareL};

% Display an empty colored grid with a given size
\newcommand{\gridsetup}[2]{
 % Arguments:
 %% #1 number of cells on the horizontal axis
 %% #2 number of cells on the vertical axis

 % Math setup 
 \pgfmathsetmacro{\x}{#1}
